* GCC seemed to have trouble with the tertiary conditional in
    database_impl<T>::read_extended_block; it gave link errors refering
    to extended_block<T>::max_size and external_block<T>::max_size.

* GCC refused to pack bidNextB next to rgbReserved, regardless of the pragma
    or attribute I gave it.

* fopen is deprecated in MSVC, so we're #ifdef'ed to use fopen_s

* MSVC fires warning C4127 (constant conditional expression) during
    instantiation of a few templates. What I'm doing is ideomatic enough
    to just disable the warning.

* MSVC really gets upset at the way the btree code works, and fires warning 
    C4250 pretty much everywhere. This warning is pretty much pointing out
    the obvious, so it's just disabled in btree.h and the files which include
    it.
